This is an atmospheric temperature profile generated by a highly simplified radiative transfer model. It calculates the temperature at a range of points (initially three) from the Earth's surface to the top of the atmosphere. The input parameters are the percentage of planetary cloud cover, the emissitivity/absorptivity of the two atmospheric layers, the convective flux within the layers, and the solar constant.
