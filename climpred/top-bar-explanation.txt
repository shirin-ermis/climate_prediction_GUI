This is an atmospheric temperature profile generated by a highly simplified radiative transfer model. It calculates the temperature at three points: at the surface, at the top of the atmosphere, and in between. The input parameters are the percentage of planetary cloud cover, the emissitivity/absorptivity of the two atmospheric layers, the convective flux within the layers, and the solar constant.
